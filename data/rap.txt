#######################################
So everyday I spend my time
Drinking wine feeling fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
This type of shit make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got em busting off the clip in the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep the saying that they cost it
For the Porsches get em nauseous
Plus I aint even mad yet niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin at the bag check
Wanna show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new rag
Thats good news
Hood dudes usually dont look like you
How Im finna get a deal and come back and the whole hood look like you
Screaming Pimp Squad hold it down
Cant drive bitch Im legally blind bitch
If I leave or die its up to me to decide
Shit niggas copping guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive in getting a piece of the pie
Is to agree with them a lot or just believe a facade bitch
And Ill be fine just drinking my wine bitch
Off again did he go
To another dimension my mind
Body soul imprisoned my eye
Probably going ballistic but listen
Im missing a couple of screws
They aint never do dreaming true you been sipping away at the truth
But besides the wisdom I do do do
Rolling do hitting switches rolling ditches blowing kisses
To the bitches hold the biscuits whats the business
Beat the system cold defendants
Blow the symptoms go to prison
Go to church and pray to father Lord forgive us
And only God can judge me
And he dont like no ugly
I look so fucking good most dykesll fuck me buddy
Yeah Im a piece of shit
I know I plead the fifth
I tell her holla if ya need some dick
The devotion its getting hopeless
Behold it Im getting closest
My soul is Im seeing ghosts
A solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions
Adjusting to the motions
And getting out all my emotions
##########################################
Hoe I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggaz youve been leadin on
Make me think about all of the rappers Ive been feedin on
Got a feelin thats the same dudes that we speakin on oh word
Aint heard my album Who you sleepin on
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin read along
Aint a fuckin sing along less you brought the weed along
Then just... okay okay okay
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put The Beatles on
All that shit you talkin bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger I dont pay for no reduction
If its comin from a nigga I dont know then I dont trust it
If you comin for my head then muhfucker get to bustin
Yes Lorrrrrd I dont really say this often
But this long dick nigga aint for the long talkin
Yeah hoe this the finale
My pep talk turned into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the Valley
Now vacayd in Atlanta then she goin back to Cali
Mm~ Got your girl on my line world on my line
The irony I fuck em at the same damn time
She eyein me like a nigga dont exist
Girl I know you want this dick
Girl Im Kendrick Lamar
A/K/A Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends need to be up to par
See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Mm kill em all dead bodies in the hallway
Dont get involved listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry halle lujah
Holla back Ill do ya
#############################################
Those huge baby eyes get to runnin off at they mouth
and tellin me everything thats on yo nasty mind
They say youre malnutritioned in need of vitamin D
and invitin me to that tingle in your spine
I love who you are love who you aint youre so Anne Frank
Lets hit the attic to hide out for bout two weeks
Rick Jamesn no chains and whips
I do suck lips til hips jerk
in double time the boy next dos a freak ha ha
##############################################
Many a day has passed the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos for these playas thought we was absent
We takin another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbing every city then we headed to that bat cave
A T L Georgia what we do for ya
Bull doggin hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy you sounding silly thank my Brougham aint sittin pretty
Doing doughnuts round you suckas like then circles around titties
Damn we the committee gone burn it down
But us gone bust you in the mouth with the chorus now
##############################################
Look give me the ball and I will have to pass it
I aint passing out until Im asthma attacking
I take a plan and then I back to back it
Hit after hit check the batting average
I take the work flip it acrobatic
Got a little time and a lot of talent
Do a little talking and a lot of action
Seen the competition hmm.. not a challenge
I lean I move I walk through in this bitch
Packed out but I can count on my hands
Who Imma talk to in this bitch
Girls from law school in this bitch
Yeah they Paralegals barely 21
Thats very legal but they doing shit thats probably barely legal
Awe man
Its that nigga that you probably least expected
I just had a couple dots that need connecting
Now your top 5 getting redirected
From here on out itll be consecutive
We making moves like Tarantino like J.J. Abrams
Moving like Channing Tatum
Moving like Jason Statham
Motherfuck the whole industry
Half of these niggas my mini mes
I got this bitch going off more than breaking and entering
You hot for a minute me
I make the shit that last for infinity
Hop in the booth man that shit like a gym to me
Dont test the agility
Silly silly thinking that the negativity
you talking could ever fuck up the tranquility
Okay okay okay Im on Rodeo for the day
If you owe me then you better pay your layaway away
Stay away or your ass might get K.O. kay today
Man that pew pew hit your ass from like way oh ways away
#######################################
I took a nap in the pulpit I never like how a suit fit
I got a pocket full of money it got me walkin all slew foot
Im on my wave like a cruise ship in that hoes mouth like a toothpick
Anyone get in my way nothin to say I tote them choppas like pool sticks bow
I wear pajamas to Ruths Chris couldnt walk a mile in my new kicks
I come from the apartments we never had our damn pool fixed
Walk in the mall with my new bitch tell her to get the whole rack
My new bitch gon pull me a new bitch then pull me a new bitch see that is a snowball effect
I got gold on my neck lookin like a Super Bowl on my neck
I got a mansion full of marble floors it look like I could go bowl in this bitch
Versace logos on bowls in this bitch like Im a serial killer
I put the real in gorilla I did this shit for my niggas
##########################################
Yo I stay with it while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it YEAH
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick YEAH
Come and get it shitted on villians by the millions
I be catchin bitches while bitches be catchin feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do
I pop bottles and hot hollow points at each and all of you cmon
A heartless bastard high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down Pass it around if you cant handle it
Hang Hollywood niggaz by they Soul Train laminates
Whats the difference between me and you What
About five back accounts three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death Im Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo breath til aint none left
Yo thats the difference
########################################
You cornballs get stonewalled blackballed I own yall
The veteran runnin my plan Im the better man
Crazy raw doin my job like the mob
Blazin yall and disappearin in the fog
or a mist and chicks cant resist what I kick
They be beggin for attention or some more of the dillznick
Word up baby someone may have to get hurt up baby
Shit is mad shady but I got to get the gravy
Platinum respect like the force of a tech
keep you hittin the deck feelin heat in your chest
Bangin your thoughts with the hot onslaught
A kid got shot on the spot for goin where he should not
Viciously I make history instantly
Those other lame ass loser ass niggaz they cant fuck with me
Im doin my thing now to lamp later on
Paid in the shade with some fly gators on
But now Im grimy as they get mud on my pants and shirt
I bet you niggaz out here know I be puttin in work
Now Ima start collectin props connectin plots
networkin like a conference cause the nonsense is yet to stop
Jakes shake me down haters wanna take me down
Break me down CLAP all they heard was the sound
Yo I scoped it out I took your weak dream and choked it out
Your bitch dont really got no ass she just poked it out
on the deelow Im sayin you versus me though
We can do this shit right here in front of your people
See time is money kid and BS walks
And to me its funny kid when you meet heads talk
I see Feds stalk they wanna dig up the dirt
Son is it me they hawk cause I be puttin in work Son
#######################################################
Whos the suspicious character strapped with the sounds profound
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
Youre in the Terrordome like my man Chuck D said
Its time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
Cause MCs have used up extended warranties
While real MCs and DJs are a minority
But right about now I use my authority
Cause Im like the Wizard and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin caps pulled low and baggy slacks
Subtractin all the rappers who lack over Premiers tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past I whup ass
Droppin lyrics that be hotter than sex and candlewax
And one dimensional MCs cant handle that
While the worlds revolvin on its axis
I come with mad love and plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this so many people
searching for false lift Im here with the skills youve missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sort of like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez...
The beat is sinister Primo makes you relax
Im like the minister when I be lacin the wax
I be bringin salvation through the way that I rap
And you know and I know Im nice like that
Work through worldly problems I got the healing power
When the mics within my reach Im feelin more power
Stealing at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
Its often easier for one to give advice
Than it is for a person to run ones own life
Thats why I cant be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines takes flight
The apparatus gets blessed and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin like the plague
MCs lucked up and got paid but still cant make the fuckin grade
How many times are wannabes gonna lie
Yo they must wanna fry they cant touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carrying my torch
The illest soldier when Im holding down the fort
On the microphone you know that Im one of the best yet
Some punks aint paid all of their debts yet
Tryin to be fly ridin high on the jet set
With juvenile rhymes makin fake ass death threats
Big deal like En Vogue heres something you can feel
Styles more tangible and image more real
For some time now Ive held the scrolls and manuscripts
When its time to go all out you be like Damn he flipped
Now Im sick fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip giving you a verbal asswhip
Dont trip its the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick    why is the press all on my di dick
My style be wilder than a kamikaze pilot
Dont try it Im about to start more than a friggin riot
Styles unsurpassable and nuccas thats suckas yo
Them motherfuckers are harrassable
For I be speaking from my parables and carry you beyond
The mics either a magic wand
Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb
Then I grab your palm no pulse youre gone
And if you thought wed lose our niche in this rap shit you way wrong
I stay up I stay on shine bright like neon
Your songs pathetic synthetic like Rayon
Fat beats they play on want dope rhymes put me on
Word is bond
#########################################
Since one time so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the glock
And Im rollin on rims
Eating soul food and neckbones from M and Ms
Grumblin like a motherfucker
Greasy ass lips now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bailin
When I hit a left I moved felon Whattup loc
Dont you know that niggaz get smoked
That take they life for a joke get in nigga
I take you to the pad zoom
Went to moms house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my low rider
Comin out feelin about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bones house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob aint nuttin but tramps
But hoes lickin us like stamps 
One fool brought the music for the yams
But Ice Cube had more amps get in bitch
Cause I had the jam on
And I dont want to hear shit about a tampon
Give me the nappy and make me happy
The hoe said Pappy could you slap me
on the ass hard and fast
and could please try not to leave a gash
I said yeah but I dont play sex
When Im putting on the latex
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night no longer steady mobbin
###########################
Left my niggas house paid what
Picked up a girl been tryin to fuck since the 12th grade
Its ironic I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punanny
And my dick runs deep so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didnt hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and Im coastin
Took another sip of the potion hit the three wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didnt even see a berry flashin those high beams
No helicopter looking for a murder 
Two in the mornin got the Fatburger 
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read Ice Cubes a pimp yeah
Drunk as hell but no throwin up 
Half way home and my pager still blowin up
Today I didnt even have to use my A.K.
I got to say it was a good day
################################
Now once upon a time not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe
This is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy
But a pussy havin no God damn sense try an push me
I try to ignore him talk to the Lord
Pray for him but some fools just love to perform
You know the type loud as a motorbike
But wouldnt bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing thats gon happen is Ima get to clappin and
he and his boys gon be yappin to the Captain
And there I go trapped in the Kit Kat again
Back through the system with the riff raff again
Fiends on the floor scratchin again
Paparazzis with they cameras snappin them
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mill for bail cause Im African
All because this fool was harassin them
Tryin to play the boy like hes saccharin
But aint nuttin sweet bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems bein a bitch aint one   hit me
######################################
Music business hate me cause the industry aint make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be makin
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it yet they all yell HOLLA
If skills sold truth be told Id probably be
lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did five mill   I aint been rhymin like Common since
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustlin since your inception
Fuck perception go with what makes sense
Since I know what Im up against
We as rappers must decide whats most impor tant
And I cant help the poor if Im one of them
So I got rich and gave back to me thats the win win
So next time you see the homey and his rims spin
Just know my mind is workin just like them
########################################
Since Im in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I aint no politician but Ill kick it with em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace and if the shoe fits Ill wear it
But if it dont then yallll swallow the truth grin and bear it
Now whos these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title put the youth in hysterics
Usin his music to steer it sharin his views and his merits
But theres a huge interference   theyre sayin you shouldnt hear it
Maybe its hatred I spew maybe its food for the spirit
Maybe its beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But Im debated disputed hated and viewed in America
as a motherfuckin drug addict   like you didnt experiment
Now now thats when you start to stare at whos in the mirror
and see yourself as a kid again and you get embarrased
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin do gooders   too bad you couldnt do good at marriage
Ha ha And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I dont
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Motherfuckers
say that Im foolish I only talk about jewels bling bling
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it
See Im influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothin I made somethin doin
what I do through and through and
I give you the news   with a twist its just his ghetto point of view
The renegade you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture bring em a lot closer to the block where they
pop toasters and they live with they moms
Got dropped roasters from botched robberies niggaz crotched over
Mommys knocked up cause she wasnt watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No hes not around   now how that sound to ya jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin round
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it
I help them see they way through it   not you
Cant step in my pants cant walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth you lose your tie and your shirt
########################################
Heh who you lovin who you wanna be fuckin
who said what why you trippin girl whys you fussin
got this model slash actress slash part time waitress
spend a whole day she hangin round with part time haters
all they do is diss dirt and put a up on my latest
itinerary but since I tend to vary see
I tend to carry more rumors than ten Mariah Careys
tend to hurries in ten places at once
plus she cant front just peep how I run mines
ma our time together is our time together and uh
our time apart is our time apart
so love Jay with your mind girl and not your heart
and some day I slow down but for now I get around
like the late Makiavelli or Perelli twenty inches
or caine and O dog stick up tape from menace
you tell em chicks if they must know my buisness
#############################################
Good morning on this day we become legendary
Everything we dreamed of
Im like the fly Malcolm X buy any jeans necessary
Detroit Red cleaned up
From the streets to the league from a eighth to a key
But you graduate when you make it up out of the streets
From the moments of pain look how far we done came
Haters sayin you changed now you doin your thang
########################################
And Im back to tear it up
Haters start your engines I hear em gearing up
People talk so much shit about me at barbershops
They forget to get their hair cut
Okay fair enough the streets is flarin up
Cause they want gun talk or I dont wear enough
Baggy clothes Reeboks or A di dos
Can I add that he do spaz out at his shows
So say goodbye to the N double A C P award
Goodbye to the In di a Arie award
Theyd rather give me the ni nigga please award
But Ill just take the I got alotta cheese award
###########################################
So I ball so hard muhfuckers wanna fine me but first niggaz gotta find me
Whats 50 grand to a muhfucker like me Can you please remind me
Ball so hard   this shit crazy yall dont know that dont shit phase me
The Nets could go 0 for 82 and I look at you like This shit gravy
Ball so hard   this shit weird we aint even posed to be here
Ball so hard   since we here its only right that we be fair
Psycho Im liable to go Michael take your pick
Jackson Tyson Jordan Game 6
Ball so hard   got a broke clock Roleys that dont tick tock
Audemars thats losin time hidden behind all these big rocks
B Ball so hard   Im shocked too Im supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped youd be in Paris gettin fucked up too
B Ball so hard   lets get faded Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles scold models spillin Ace on my sick Js
B Ball so hard   bitch behave just might let you meet Ye
Chi Towns D. Rose Im movin the Nets to B.K.
###########################################
What you doin in the club on a Thursday
She said she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21 but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walk around always mad reputation
Leave a pretty girl sad reputation
I wanna fuck you hard on the sink
After that give you somethin to drink
############################################
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box
They said I rap like a robot so call me Rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes/jeans I got a laptop in my back pocket
But as rude and as indecent as all hell syllables skill a holic   kill em all with
this flippity dippity hippity hip hop you dont really wanna get into a pissin match with this rappidy rap
Packin a Mac in the back of the Ac backpack rap crap yap yap yackety yack
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicin that
Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow All I do is drop F bombs feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin a rough time period heres a maxi pad
Its actually disastrously bad for the wack while Im masterfully constructin this masterpiece yeah
###############################################
Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy and I like good trees
Smoke so much weed you wouldnt beleive
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessey
Ive been to the muthafuckin mountain top
Heard muthafuckers talk see em dropped
If I aint got a weapon Ima pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass Im gon continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your two left feet
Its real easy just follow the beat
Dont let that fine girl pass you bye
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
Im a menace a dentist an oral hygentist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this flouride rininse
Swish but dont spit it swallow and Ill finish
Yeah me and Nate d o double g
Looking for a couple biyitches with some double ds
Pop a little champagne and a couple Es
Slip it in her bubbuly we finna finna have a party
###########################################
Till I collapse Im spillin these raps long as you feel em
Till the day that I drop youll never say that Im not killin em
Cause when I am not then Ima stop pinnin em
and I am not hip hop and Im just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts when Ima stop sendin em
Women are caught in webs spin em and hoch venom
Adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop
Amoxacillins just not real enough
The criminal cop killin hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Youre comin with me feel it or not youre gonna fear it
like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin up
Fo shizzle my wizzle this is the plot listen up
You bizzles forgot Slizzel does not give a fuck
################################################
Goddamn I feel amazin damn Im in the matrix
My mind is livin on Cloud 9 and this nine is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and VROOM VROOM Im racin
Poppin pills in the lobby and I pray they dont find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ if I live life on my knees aint no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders next to that Churchs Chicken
All you pussies is losers all my niggas is winners screamin
All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower
I pray my dick get big as the Eiffel Tower
So I can fuck the world for seventy two hours
##################################################
Still Im at it peel the plastic off it you can feel the magic
Still Im laughin at the critics talkin I can see em gaggin
When Im back in the back of my city back in the bach
with a batch of them bangin Dre Beats with me look where Im at
Its the murder cap and Im captain at birthin this gangsta rap
Its a wrap when Im done and I come a long way 
from a hundred dollars a month to a hundred mil in a day bitch Im from
#####################################################
 really hope you play this
Cause ol girl you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one off vacations
Youve been taken
Clearly a lot for me to take in
It dont make sense
Young East African Girl you too busy fucking with your other man
I was trying to put you on game put you on a plane
Take you and your mama to the motherland
I could do it maybe one day
When you figure out youre gonna need someone
When you figure out its all right here in the city
And you dont run from where we come from
That sound like Poetic Justice Poetic Justice
You were so new to this life but God damn you got adjusted
I mean I write poems in these songs dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress
Good God what you doing that walk for
When I see that thing move I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
And they say communication saves relations I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real
#######################################################
Imagine Rock up in the projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus dont miss them stockings liquor spillin pistols poppin
Bakin soda yola whippin aint no turkey on Thanksgiving
My homeboy just domed a nigga I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue everyday Im hustlin
What else is a thug to do when you eatin cheese from the government
Gotta provide for my daughter nem get the fuck up out my way bish
Got that drum and got them bands just like a parade bish
Drop that work up in the bushes hope them boys dont see my stash
If they do tell the truth this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass aint cut them serpents lurkin blood
Bitches sellin pussy niggas sellin drugs but its all good
Broken promises steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your Js and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me gettin shaded under a money tree
######################################################
Im trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
Youre trying to keep it deprived and only co sign what radio does
And Im looking right past you we live in a world we live in a world 
on two different axles you live in a world you living behind the mirror
I know what you scared of the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital I know you had to this shit is vital I know you had to
To die in a pitiful vain tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain rather a seasonal name Ill let the people know 
this is something you can blame on yourselves you can remain stuck in a box
Imma break out and then hide every lock Imma break out and then hide every lock

I got I got I got I got loyalty got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power poison pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this since one like this immaculate conception
I transform like this perform like this was Yeshuas new weapon
I dont contemplate I meditate then off your fuckin head
This that put the kids to bed

I just kill shit cause its in my DNA
I got millions I got riches buildin in my DNA
I got dark I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again then win again like Wimbledon I serve
Yeah thats him again the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work I know just who you are
See yous a yous a yous a bitch your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched heritage inside your DNA
Backbone dont exist born outside a jellyfish I gauge
See my pedigree most definitely dont tolerate the front
Shit Ive been through prolly offend you this is Paulas oldest son
I know murder conviction burners boosters burglars ballers dead redemption
Scholars fathers dead with kids and I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah yeah yeah yeah soldiers DNA
Born inside the beast my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9 on cell motel we didnt have nowhere to stay
At 29 Ive done so well hit cartwheel in my estate
And Im gon shine like Im supposed to antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work and absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve and thats a riff gonna plead this case
The reason my powers here on Earth salute the truth when the prophet say
#########################################################
I got so many theories and suspicions
Im diagnosed with real nigga conditions
Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close get money fuck bitches
I double parked the Aston in the red
My momma told me that Ima work myself to death
My girl told me dont let these hoes get in my head
My world been ecstatic I checked the signal that read

Causin lyrical disasters its the master
Make music for Mini Mes models and Fat Bastards
These women tryin yo get me out my Pelle Pelle
They strip off my clothes and tell me Get in my belly
Stay on the track hit the ground runnin like Flo Jo
Sent back in time and Ive never lost my mojo
Ladies and gentlemen ahh boys and girls
Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world
Yes indeed Ludacris Im hotter than Nevada
Ready to break the steerin column on yo Impala
If I get caught bail out po po I tell em holla
In court I never show up like Austin Powers fa zha
Father father and hey I love gold
But can buy anything I want from the records Ive sold
Jacuzzis hot Cristal is so cold
Neighbors catch contacts from the blunts that Ive rolled
A pig in a blanket a smoke and a pancake
Drop albums non stop once a year for my fans sake
I crush mics until my hand breaks
Then shag now and shag later til these women cant stand straight
The Luda meister got em feelin so randy
Im XXL so I call em my Eye Candy
Brush my shoulder and I pop my collar
Cause Im worth a million ga zillion fa fillion dollars

Let that let that nigga know he in love with that coco
Why these bitches dont never be learnin

Flippin on that work trippin off that purp
Flippin up my skirt and I be whippin all that work
Takin trips with all them kis car keys got bs

Im the big kahuna go let them hoes know
Just on this song alone bitch is on her fourth flow

Remember back in the days when niggaz had waves
Gazelle shades and corn braids
Pitchin pennies honies had the high top jellies
Shootin skelly motherfuckers was all friendly
Loungin at the barbeques drinkin brews
with the neighborhood crews hangin on the avenues
Turn your pagers to nineteen ninety three
Niggaz is gettin smoked G believe me
Talk slick you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggaz aint havin that shit
Totin techs for rep smokin blunts in the project
hallways shootin dice all day
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit
So step away with your fist fight ways
Motherfucker this aint back in the days but you dont hear me though

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies
The back of the club sippin Moet is where youll find me
The back of the club mackin hoes my crews behind me
Mad question askin blunt passin music blastin

Jump in the Rover and come over

Givin ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin os smokin lye an Optimos
Money hoes and clothes all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure whatever

However living better now Coogi sweater now
Drop top BMs Im the man girlfriend

Super Nintendo Sega Genesis 
When I was dead broke man I couldnt picture this 
50 inch screen money green leather sofa 
Got two rides a limousine with a chauffeur 
Phone bill about two Gs flat 
No need to worry my accountant handles that 
And my whole crew is loungin 
Celebratin every day no more public housin 
Thinkin back on my one room shack 
Now my mom pimps a Ac with minks on her back 
And she loves to show me off of course 
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source 
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us 
No heat wonder why Christmas missed us 
Birthdays was the worst days 
Now we sip champagne when we thirst ay 
Uh damn right I like the life I live 
Cause I went from negative to positive
