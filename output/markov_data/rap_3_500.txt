hawk cause i be puttin in work 
now ima start collectin props connectin plots 
networkin like a conference cause the nonsense is yet to stop 
jakes shake me down haters wanna take me down 
break me down clap all they heard was the sound 
yo i scoped it out i took your weak dream and choked it out 
on the microphone you know that im one of the best yet 
some punks aint paid all of their debts yet 
tryin to be fly ridin high on the jet set 
with juvenile rhymes makin fake ass death threats 
big deal like en vogue heres something you can feel the magic 
still im at it peel the plastic off it you can feel the magic 
still im at it peel the plastic off it you can feel the magic 
still im laughin at the critics talkin i can see em gaggin 
when im putting on the latex 
slipped on the condom 
fucked around and dropped the bomb son 
and it read ice cubes a pimp yeah 
drunk as hell but no throwin up  
half way home and my pager still blowin up 
today i didnt even have to use my ak 
i got i got i got loyalty got royalty inside my dna 
cocaine quarter piece got war and peace inside my dna 
i got so many theories and suspicions 
im diagnosed with real nigga conditions 
today is the day i follow my intuition

i aint got to slow down for you to catch up bitch 
####################################### 
you can call this my new shit but it aint new though 
i dont wanna hear im actin different 
same lips that be ass kissin 
these hoes aint what they say they are 
and their pussy stank theyre catfishin 
same hoes that was sendin shots 
they reachin out like their back itchin 
why would i hop in some beef 
when i was dead broke man i couldnt picture this  
50 inch screen money green leather sofa  
got two rides a limousine with a chauffeur  
phone bill about two gs flat  
no need to worry my accountant handles that  
and my dick runs deep so deep 
so deep put her ass to sleep 
woke her up around one 
she didnt hesitate to call ice cube the top gun 
drove her to the pad zoom 
went to moms house and dropped a load in the bathroom 
jumped back in my low rider 
comin out feelin about ten pounds lighter 
went to moms house and dropped a load in the bathroom
